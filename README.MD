This is the second version of my implementation of the paper. 

`This is the code of the paper` 
**Direct Photometric Alignment by Mesh Deformation**
`which implemented by myself totally by myself.
during the test i found the area outside overlap area will have too much deformation,
then i add one more constrain to let the vertices not change too much.`

by the way,the sample distance and the size of mesh boxes are all set in the config yaml.


The environment is 
**python3.6,** 
**vlfeat,**
**opencv with contrib**
The envirment of cpp is
**opencv3.4,**
**eigen,**
**pybind11**
